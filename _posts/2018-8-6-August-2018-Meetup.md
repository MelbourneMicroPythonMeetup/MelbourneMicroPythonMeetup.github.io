## A Taste of MicroPython
Damien George, Matt Trentini and Nick Moore presented _A Taste of MicroPython_ at [MPUG](https://wiki.python.org/moin/MelbournePUG) on the 6 August 2018. 

Seemed to be well received by the Melbourne Pythonistas! Plenty of interest and questions as well as much poking and prodding of hardware after the talk. 

Thanks to Ed Schofield and the MPUG crew for being lovely hosts.
