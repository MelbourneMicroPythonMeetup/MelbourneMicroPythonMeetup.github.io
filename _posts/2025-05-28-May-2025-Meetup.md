#### mip-ifying the Amazing List - with Claude's help

![Claude Code](../images/2025-05/claude.webp)

- Oliver and I decided to have a *hack session*
- Goal: Go through the [Awesome List](https://awesome-micropython.com/) and add
  `mip` support to as many libraries as possible!
  - \>1K URLs (~800 Github/Gitlab links, not all libraries)
- Used [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) to assist
  - Help select candidate libraries
  - Fork the repos
  - Add an appropriate `package.json`
  - Raise PRs

There were **~120 PRs raised**, ~20 have been accepted. There's another batch of
Gitlab PRs to come, too.

Claude wasn't perfect, there were a few mistakes, it required some
back-and-forth and it *wasn't free*. The session, including 5-ish hours of
compute cost ~AU$65.

But it would have been a very, *very* tedious task - I'm convinced I wouldn't
have completed it.

#### PyCon AU

![PyCon AU](../images/2025-05/pyconau2025.png)

[PyCon AU 2025](https://2025.pycon.org.au/) has been announced - for here in
Melbourne - and the [Call for Proposals](https://2025.pycon.org.au/program/) is
open! It closes on the 15th June so do consider presenting a talk (particularly
if it's MicroPython-related!).

### Improving Garbage Collection Time

![Improving Garbage Collection Time](../images/2025-05/gccircuitpython.jpg)

CircuitPython lead dev, Scott Shawcroft, published a [blog post on improving
garbage collection time in
CircuitPython](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/04/28/improving-garbage-collection-time-in-circuitpython/).
Scott had observed that GC collection times could blow out, particularly with
the larger memory available on newer micros. Digging further, Scott discovered
some worst-case scenarios where the `gc.collect()` could take almost 20 seconds! 

The workaround implemented in CircuitPython is to use [selective
collect](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/10264), effectively
informing the gc to ignore certain allocations. It can dramatically improve gc
collections for some scenarios.

Scott has been in touch with Damien since the same gc is present in MicroPython.

### MIDI Controlled Acoustic Crank Organ

![Crank Organ](../images/2025-05/animacion_organillo.gif)

This [MIDI controlled acoustic crank
organ](https://github.com/orgs/micropython/discussions/17278) by bixb922 is
absolutely delightful! And the more you dig into this project, the more it
reveals...

The crank inflates bellow to maintains a reservoir of air - and the rotation
determines the playback speed. Solenoids control the air flowing into the pipes,
carefully timed by MicroPython software running on an ESP32-S3. The tunes are
defined by MIDI files and a playlist can be managed with app rendered in a
browser. 

*Favourite feature*: A microphone is used to automatically iterate through the
solenoids and play each pipe to detect the note and use it for configuration.

*Everything* - hardware, mechanics, software - is available on the
[crank-organ](https://github.com/bixb922/crank-organ) repo and the software
[design and
development](https://github.com/bixb922/crank-organ/blob/main/design_and_development/design_and_development.md)
write-up is full of gems.

### TV-B-Gone

![TV-B-Gone](../images/2025-05/tvbgone.jpeg)

Ned Konz [announced](https://github.com/orgs/micropython/discussions/17326) that
he's created a (improved!) clone of the popular ol' [TV-B-Gone using
MicroPython](https://github.com/bikeNomad/micropython-tv-b-gone). 

The TV-B-Gone emits a whole bunch of TV infrared signals to turn off many TV's.
The old project no longer worked for many modern TVs and was built around the
aging ATTiny. Ned has updated it to run on MicroPython, on an ESP32-S3, and has
updated the TV support.

Apart from being a cool project, there's also a detailed README explaining how
it works and how to construct your own.

### Remote Soil Monitoring

![Soil Monitor](../images/2025-05/soilmonitor.webp)

If you've ever wanted to remotely monitor the moisture in your soil you have to
check out Brian (and brother Andrew) Dorey's excellent project: [Raspberry Pi
Pico, LoRa & Home Assistant remote soil
monitoring](https://www.briandorey.com/post/pi-pico-lora-remote-soil-monitor). 

Brian's polytunnel is a kilometer from their house so they need to remotely
monitor the state of the soil. They employ soil moisture sensing, LoRa, humidity
sensing, e-ink, solar power and battery charging, orchestrating it all with
MicroPython. Back at home they tie it in to a Home Assistant system to display
the information.

It's a *brilliant* write-up on the design of the project and includes many
crucial details. The code and hardware designs are available at
[pi-pico-lora-soil-monitor](https://github.com/briandorey/pi-pico-lora-soil-monitor).

### SAM

![SAM TTS](../images/2025-05/samtts.jpg)

Quan Lin has done a superb job of porting the old SAM (Software Automatic Mouth)
Text-To-Speech program to pure Python:
[micropython-smatts](https://github.com/jacklinquan/micropython-samtts).

SAM was cutting-edge 40 years ago so [calibrate your
enthusiasm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elD4RoNKWXM&t=28s) (any Andor
fans?), this won't compete with modern LLM TTS. I remember being *astonished* by
it when using it on my Commodore64 back in the day and to see it running on
microcontrollers filled me with nostalgic joy. 

You can try [SAM in the
browser](https://jacklinquan.github.io/micropython-samtts/) to get a feel for
the results.

### HUB75 MicroPython LED Matrix Driver

![Hub75](../images/2025-05/hub75.png)

Excellent work from Andy Crook with his
[Hub75-24bit](https://github.com/andycrook/Hub75-24bit/) RP2 driver. Hub75's are
the large, cheap LED panels, in this case a 64x64 matrix. His driver provides
24-bit colour, HW accelerated drawing (via PIO), BMP loading, font support and
3D textured model support (!). There's even a particle system. 

Andy has also published a [bunch of examples on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/CMDR_Crook/submitted/).
