#### MicroPythonOS

> "...a lightweight and versatile operating system built entirely in MicroPython. Designed for microcontrollers like the ESP32 and desktop systems, MicroPythonOS offers a modern, Android-inspired interface with an app ecosystem, App Store, and Over-The-Air (OTA) updates."

Initially with out-of-the-box support for Waveshare's [ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-2](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-2) dev kit, or also desktop Linux using SDL for graphics.

Tickets for [PyCon AU 2025](https://2025.pycon.org.au/) are on sale now!

The event will be held from Friday the 12th to Tuesday the 16th of September at Pullman Melbourne On The Park.

Early Bird tickets have already sold out, "Enthusiast" tickets for the full three days are $550, or $220 for a single day. Tickets include full catering, and a t-shirt.

I'm not sure specifically if there's any MicroPython talks this year, check out the program though to see if there's anything that interests you.
