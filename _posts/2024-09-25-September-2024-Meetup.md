*Volodymyr* explains how to embed any language (that compiles to wasm) into a native module, *Matt* gives the news round-up.

## News Round-up

### Updates

#### Moving away from Meetup.com

![Meetup logo](../images/2024-09/meetup_logo.png)

Despite the 1000-odd users, this will be the last gathering organised with
meeetup.com. The service has become *very* expensive and doesn't warrant the
cost.

I'll share what we'll use in the future via all the regular channels (including
meetup before we leave).

#### mpbuild

![Midjourney MPBuild](../images/2024-09/midjouney_mpbuild.png)

[mpbuild](https://github.com/mattytrentini/mpbuild) has been overhauled with a
much clearer 'board database'. Further, a request has been made to provide
access to the features as a Python module, not just as a CLI app, someething
like this:

```python
import mpbuild

mpbuild.build("RPI_PICO2")
# Or build the variant
mpbuild.build("RPI_PICO2", "RISCV")

# Alternatively...
db = mpbuild.database()
db.boards["RPI_PICO2"].build()
db.boards["RPI_PICO2"].variants["RISCV"].build()
```

That's not ready yet, but isn't far away - and will make integration into other
tools much easier.

mpbuild is still not *quite* ready for widespread release...but getting very
close! Special thanks to Oliver, Andrew, Jos and Hans for their early
contributions.

#### Hans and his Tentacles

![Tentacles](../images/2024-09/tentacles.png)

I've just received the prototype *Tentacles* from Hans! If anyone would like to
help progress automated HIL testing on MicroPython please get in contact with
me; we're looking for folks that could help run tests on devices using the
Tentacles.

#### MicroPython Memory Profiler

![MicroPython Memory Profiler](../images/2024-09/memory_profiler.png)

[Planet Innovation](https://planetinnovation.com/) - the company that employs
Andrew and I - have agreed to release the [MicroPython Memory
Profiler](https://github.com/pi-mst/micropython-memory-profiler). It's an
in-house tool originally written mostly by Damien for a project where fragmented
memory was an issue when running a device for many hours/days.

*Quick demo!*

### Headlines

#### Raspberry Pi RP2350 Errata 9

After all the excitement of the RP2350 announcement, unfortunately a fairly
nasty hardware issue has been discovered. Errata 9 or E9 affects all GPIOs when
in input mode - it seems like this means that internal pull-downs can't be used
when the pin is in input mode.

Details are still emerging. Hackaday have been reporting on the issue pretty
clearly, take a look at [Raspberry Pi RP2350-E9 Erratum Redefined As Input Mode
Leakage
Current](https://hackaday.com/2024/09/20/raspberry-pi-rp2350-e9-erratum-redefined-as-input-mode-leakage-current/)

### M5Stack

#### AtomS3R

![M5Stack AtomS3R](../images/2024-09/m5stack_atoms3r.webp)

M5Stack have release a second S3-based Atom, the
[AtomS3R](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/atoms3r-dev-kit). The improvements
over the original
[AtomS3](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/atoms3-dev-kit-w-0-85-inch-screen) is
that this has 8MB of PSRAM, a more powerful IMU system and a better antenna
arrangement.

**US$17.50** (US$2 more expensive than the original)

#### AtomS3R Cam

![M5Stack AtomS3R-Cam](../images/2024-09/m5stack_atoms3r-cam.webp)

There's a new camera too, the [Atom S3R-Cam](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/atoms3r-camera-kit), the first in the Atom form factor. Take the AtomS3R,
remove the display and replace it with a 0.3MP camera.

**US$20**

#### Roller485 [Lite]

![M5Stack Roller485](../images/2024-09/m5stack_roller485.webp)

Two new interesting brushless DC motors were released. The
[Roller485](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/roller485-lite-unit-without-slip-ring-stm32)
and [Roller485
Lite](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/roller485-lite-unit-without-slip-ring-stm32)
are 5/6-16V-powered motors. They have encoders, a built-in STM micro for control
and RS-485 or I2C interfaces. There's even a small display on the rear for
configuration.

There's a Grove port, connected via a slip-ring, on the non-Lite version (to connect Grove to the )

**US$37** or **$30** for the Lite

### Makerdiary i.MX RT1011 Nano Kit

The [i.MX RT1011 Nano Kit](https://makerdiary.com/products/imxrt1011-nanokit) is
a new board for sale at Makerdiary. I'm becoming quite a fan of the RT range
from NXP! If you want to try one out, this is a great board to start with.

Cytron have released the [Cytron IRIV IO
Controller](https://www.cytron.io/p-iriv-io-controller?r=1), an RP2350-based
industrial controller.

Control isolated IO (11 input, 4 output, 2 analog in) up to 50V over Ethernet
with RS485 thrown in for good measure.

Looks like good documentation and they advertise MicroPython support.

**US$65**
