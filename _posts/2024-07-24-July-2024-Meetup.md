## News Round-up

### Headlines

#### Tulip

We looked at Tulip back in...but it's come a long way.

#### ViperIDE

We looked at ViperIDE [last
month](https://melbournemicropythonmeetup.github.io/June-2024-Meetup/) but the
improvements continue!

One of the more recent noteworthy features is that there is now an [experimental
version of ViperIDE](https://viper-ide.org/?vm=1) that simulates a device
*inside the browser* using the MicroPython WASM build. Very neat!

#### PyCon AU: Call for proposals

![PyCon AU 2024](../images/2024-06/pyconau2024.png)

As noted [last
month](https://melbournemicropythonmeetup.github.io/June-2024-Meetup/), PyCon
AU's [call for proposals](https://2024.pycon.org.au/program/) closed last
Sunday, the 21st. Good luck to those of you who submitted a proposal!

#### Programming ESP32: Learn MicroPython Coding and Electronics [book]

![Programming ESP32](../images/2024-06/progesp32book.png)

(Matt received the book, feel free to take a look! It's a really nice
introductory text.)

### Matt's New Hardware

Waveshare? Nope. Next month!

---

### Hardware News

#### LilyGo

[Could add the new LilyGo devices]

---

### Software News

#### ESP32-C6, ESP32-C2 and ESP32-H2 port

![ESP32-C6](../images/2024-06/esp32-c6-overview.png)

The [ESP32-C6 port](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/pull/11869) has
been added to the [v1.24
milestone](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/milestone/7).

[TrekMax](https://github.com/TrekMax) has added a PR for [ESP32-C2
support](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/pull/15440). If anyone is interested in these devices, please build and test this PR.

ESP32-H2 support has not yet been added but all three of these device require
similar changes - using the C6 and C2 as guides should make it pretty
straightforward to add the H2.

#### ESP-File Manager

### Projects

#### Look Mum No Pixels: a Mini Vector Display

![Vector Display](../images/2024-07/vectordisplay.jpg)

Nick Moore (founder of this meetup!) has started writing up his latest project:
Using MicroPython to control a Vector Display. [Look Mum No Pixels: a Mini Vector Display](https://nick.zoic.org/art/mini-vector-display/)

### Final Thoughts

#### Always consider...

...that your threat model might be incomplete

The MicroMac is an old-school Macintosh for under Â£5! Built out of one of our
faves, the Raspberry Pi Pico.

#### How to train simple AIs to balance a double pendulum

An *excellent* video from [Pezzza's Work](https://www.youtube.com/@PezzzasWork)
that explains how to train a neural network to balance a double pendulum.

Although an ideal ML application, before I watched the video I wouldn't have
been *entirely* sure it would be *possible* to balance a double pendulum using
this method; they're inherently very chaotic! Spoiler alert: It is, and now I
can't help but wonder if a 3x (or 10x pendulum? 1000x??) is possible...

It would be *fascinating* trying to build this with MicroPython and seeing how
the real world would affect performance.
